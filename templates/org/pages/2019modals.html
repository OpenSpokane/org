                    Ruth Sampson Ayers (1898-1991) - Ruth Sampson Ayers, musician and business owner, was a lifelong Spokane resident whose parents came from Sweden in the 1880s. Ms. Ayers graduated from North Central High School in 1918. As a high school senior, she had already directed the choir at Fourth Presbyterian Church. She began working for Pacific Music Company when she was a teenager and opened the sheet music department there. In 1929, she opened the Ruth Sampson Sheet Music Company and changed the name when she married Stephen Ayers in 1945. The Sampson-Ayers House of Music had a piano and organ department, music practice rooms, and a recital hall in addition to selling sheet music. She sang as a soloist and directed many Spokane choirs throughout her life. Ms. Ayers helped organize the Spokane Philharmonic Orchestra and served as a board member for many groups that brought music to Spokane. She volunteered with school orchestras and organized the Spokane Music Festival for young artists. In 1979, she sold her business after her husband’s death but remained an active member of many civic organizations until her death in 1991.

                    Eric A. Johnston (1895-1963) was a national and international figure who served as a model of unselfish public service and philanthropy. Ina Hughes Johnston (1896-1991), a Spokane native, helped Spokane for decades with a long record of civic achievement and responsibility. Their legacy is still felt in Spokane through the Johnston-Hanson Foundation and the Johnston-Fix Foundation, which have a long record of philanthropy for education, the arts, children’s welfare, social work and so much more. Mr. Johnston served as president of the Motion Picture Association of America and the United States Chamber of Commerce. Because of his work, they lived for many years in Washington, D. C. but they always considered Spokane to be home. Their living family members continue to carry on Ina and Eric’s work, and their passion for giving continues to be evident throughout the Spokane community.

                    <p>
                    Dr. John Moyer (1922-2014) - John Moyer, Spokane physician and legislator, was born in Montana in 1922. After graduating from high school in Fargo, North Dakota, John attended North Dakota State University before being drafted into the army during World War II. He completed his undergraduate degree after his return, including one year at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. He later attended the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago, and he completed his residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Cook County Hospital. In 1955, he relocated to Spokane where he served as a physician for thirty years, delivering more than 7,000 babies in Spokane and the surrounding area. In addition to his medical practice, Dr. Moyer was politically active, represented Spokane in the Washington State Legislature for ten years, and served on numerous local boards and committees. He was instrumental in promoting the importance of the Spokane River Gorge as “a rare and tremendous feature to be prized and preserved.” Rather than merely opposing the Lincoln Street bridge construction project that would have ruined the view of Spokane Falls, Moyer offered a positive vision that inspired hundreds of citizens to coalesce around the proposition that the community was better served by preserving the views of the falls. Dr. Moyer was married to Caroline Atkinson and together they raised ten children. After her death, he married Joanne Halstead and they were married for twenty-seven years.

                    Ed Tsutakawa (1921-2006) - Ed Tsutakawa, Spokane artist, civic leader, businessman and community activist, championed the Sister City relationship with Nishinomiya. Tsutakawa was born in Seattle in 1921, but at the age of six, his parents sent him to their native Nishinomiya to attend school. After graduating from high school in Seattle, he enrolled at the University of Washington but after Pearl Harbor, was sent to Minidoka, a Japanese internment camp. After nine months, he was drafted into the U. S. army, where he served for the rest of the war. When the war ended, he came to Spokane, where he became a printer and artist. He designed logos and catalogs and spent the rest of his life in Spokane, devoted to his community. Tsutakawa advised mayors and originated the idea of a sister city relationship with Nishinomiya. As a Sister City with Nishinomiya, Spokane has benefitted with the construction of the Japanese Garden in Manito Park and Mukagawa College at the old Fort George Wright site. He was instrumental in bringing a Japanese planner to design the garden. After retiring from his printing business, Tsutakawa joined the administration at Mukagawa.  After his death in 2006, the Park Board renamed the Japanese garden in his honor.

She obtained her master’s degree in Educational Administration with principal’s credentials and started as a school administrator starting in the 1980s. In 1988, she moved to Spokane having been hired to become the principal of Lidgerwood Elementary, Hutton Elementary, and the Libby Center. She was principal for the district’s most brilliant third through eighth graders, and the district’s most medically fragile. Here she learned that there were essentially six types of gifted students, four of which were extremely at risk, especially at risk of dropping out of high school. Ninety percent of the community, including state legislators, did not know this about gifted students, so she began educating community and state leaders about the special needs of high ability students. Johnson retired in 2010 after 37 years in public education and founded two nonprofit organizations, PRODIGY NORTHWEST and INVENT WASHINGTON. She continues to volunteer with Prodigy Northwest and Invent Washington to this day.

                    The City of Spokane and the people of Spokane have been very warm and accepting of me and my family, despite being an immigrant from Lebanon with a strong accent.  Parents of my patients trusted me with the lives of their precious children, and the medical community here has supported my dreams and aspirations.  Without this trust and support, I would not have been able to achieve what I have in this community.  Thank you Spokane .

                    The City of Spokane is meaningful to me, because it is my home and was the home of my great grandparents, my grandparents and my mother and father.
I grew up here. Though Spokane has not always been ideal for us, as black citizens, Spokane has at least tried and I love this city.
