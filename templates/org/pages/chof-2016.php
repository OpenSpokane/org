	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		King Cole, President of Expo &lsquo;74, was a 20<sup>th</sup> century visionary who changed the face of downtown Spokane.
	  	  	  		Cole was born in Colorado and served with the Navy during World War II before attending college and law school in California. 
	  	  	  		He was working as director of San Leandro, California’s development program when he came to Spokane in 1963 to assume leadership of Spokane Unlimited. 
	  	  	  		His mission was to revitalize the downtown business district and help Spokane’s sluggish economy. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		When he arrived in Spokane, railroad yards obscured the polluted Spokane River as it flowed through downtown.  
	  	  	  		Cole brought community groups together to clean up the river and the city’s image. Under Cole’s leadership, a business and citizens’ coalition came up with the idea of hosting a World’s Fair, but Expo was a means to an end to revitalize the river and downtown. 
	  	  	  		Cole coordinated local, state and national leaders and was instrumental in brokering the deal with the city and railroad officials for a land swap. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Expo &lsquo;74 was a huge success with Spokane becoming the smallest city ever to host a world’s fair, but its real achievement was the transformation of the river and the falls along with the creation of Riverfront Park. 
	  	  	  		He continued to support community partnerships for urban planning until his death in 2010.

	  	  	  	</blockquote>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Chief Spokan Garry, Indian leader, educator, missionary and farmer, was born around 1811.  
	  	  	  		His real name was Slough-Keetcha, and he was the son of the Spokan Chief Illm-Spokanee (<span class="chof-salish-regular">ilmz sPQNi/</span>). 
	  	  	  		In 1825, his father sent him to the Red River missionary society school established by the Hudson’s Bay Company where he was given the name Spokan Garry. 
	  	  	  		Garry spent five years at Red River, where he learned to speak, read and write both English and French. 
	  	  	  		When he returned, he taught both children and adults Christianity, as well as English and agricultural techniques.

	  	  	  		<img class="alignright img-rounded" style="width:160px; border: 1px solid #ccc;" src="/assets/img/promos/chof/Spokan_ChiefGarry-b.jpg">
	  	  	  		Because of his role as leader of the Middle and Upper bands of the Spokane tribe, along with his English language skills, Garry represented his people in treaty negotiations in the extraordinary times of military conflict with the white settlers. 
	  	  	  		Garry was a man of peace who tried to persuade the Spokane Indians not to fight the U. S. Army. 
	  	  	  		From 1859 until his death, Garry worked unsuccessfully to establish a reservation for the Spokane tribe on their homeland. 
	  	  	  		After white settlers dispossessed Garry and his family of his farm in 1888, Garry lived in poverty in Indian Canyon until his death in 1892.

	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Daniel K. Oliver was a thirty-three year old Civil War veteran from Pennsylvania who arrived in 1878 to what would later become the City of Spokane. 
	  	  	  		A skilled carpenter, he was also an entrepreneur who invested in a wood mill and became a manager in a planning company. 
	  	  	  		He later branched out into mining and real estate. 
	  	  	  		In 1896, Oliver was elected to serve a two-year term on the city council in Ward 2 (currently lower South Hill). 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Oliver was also an entrepreneur with investments in the timber industry, mining and real estate; all crucial industries in Spokane's early history. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		In 1892, he built Oliver Hall, a two-story brick building with a society hall on the second floor.

	  	  	  	</blockquote>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		May Arkwright Hutton, working woman and suffragette, is still widely known in Spokane almost a hundred years after her death. 
	  	  	  		May was born in Ohio and migrated to Idaho in 1883 to take part in the gold rush.  
	  	  	  		Settling in Wardner Junction, she worked as a cook in a saloon before opening her own boardinghouse. 
	  	  	  		In 1887, she met and married Levi Hutton, a train engineer and they moved to Wallace, Idaho. 
	  	  	  		May worked running the restaurant in the Wallace hotel and was a union activist in violent times. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		In 1897, the Huttons bought a small interest in the Hercules mine and in 1901, the mine began producing silver. 
	  	  	  		Within ten years, they were millionaires but May’s lack of social skills, brusque manner and strong opinions did not fit into the social life of the wives of mine owners. 
	  	  	  		In 1904, she decided to run for the Idaho state legislature. 
	  	  	  		She won the Democratic ticket, but lost the election. 
	  	  	  		The Huttons moved to Spokane in 1906 and in moving to Washington, May lost her right to vote. 
	  	  	  		She quickly became active in the suffrage movement until Washington voters granted women the right to vote in 1910. 
	  	  	  		She was the first woman juror in Spokane County. 
	  	  	  		She remained active in Democratic politics, the peace movement and many charitable organizations supporting women and children. 
	  	  	  		When she died in 1915 at the age of 55, she was eulogized as an “author, suffragist, philosopher, humanitarian… who always fought on the moral side of all questions, and never forgot the poor and unfortunate.”
