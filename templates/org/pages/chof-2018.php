	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Cataldo first opened a small school at Saint Joseph, where he taught both Indian and White students. 
	  	  	  		To expand the mission, Cataldo purchased two parcels of land. 
	  	  	  		The first was north of Spokane and was used for the relocation of St. Michael’s mission, becoming Mount Saint Michael. 
	  	  	  		The second parcel was located on the Spokane River, purchased in 1881 and in 1887, he established Gonzaga College at that site. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>	
	  	  	  		He continued to serve at missions all over the Northwest, including Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Alaska and Wyoming.

	  	  	  		<small>Eleanor Chase</small>
	  	  	  	</blockquote>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		James E. Chase, Spokane mayor and civic leader, grew up in a poor family in segregated Texas. 
	  	  	  		He attended high school at an all-black high school in Ballinger, Texas but his schooling ended when the school closed at the height of the Great Depression. 
	  	  	  		He never received a high school diploma. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		With two friends, he hopped on a freight train in 1934 and settled in Spokane. 
	  	  	  		His first job in Spokane was as a porter and shoe-shiner at a hotel, the only job available for a black man. 
	  	  	  		With another hotel porter, Chase helped form the Negro Active League, a social networking organization, to advance the cause of better opportunities for African Americans. 
	  	  	  		In 1939, he and a friend started an auto repair business, which remained in business until 1981 when Chase ran for mayor. 
	  	  	  		In 1942, he married Eleanor Barrow, a descendant of black pioneers in Spokane. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		James later said that Eleanor was "the person who influenced my life the most" and that "all of my goals, desires and accomplishments are geared with her happiness in mind.” 
	  	  	  		Eleanor stayed at home until their son was 11 and then worked for sixteen years as a social worker and then for nine years as an adoption and juvenile court officer. 
	  	  	  		Eleanor was a classically trained singer and was a soloist at Westminster Congregational Church for thirty years. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
					In 1950, James was elected president of the Spokane Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). 
					He served as president for 17 of the next 19 years, with a two-year hiatus as vice-president. 
				</p>
				<p>
				 	He first ran for city council in 1969 and was defeated. 
					He ran again in 1975 and became Spokane’s first black city council member. 
					Chase ran for mayor in 1981 and won by a landslide. 
					During his term in office, Chase was known for pulling people together to effect change. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Eleanor attended every city council meeting during all of James’ years in office and they were considered a strong team. 
					Eleanor also served as a trustee for Whitworth and Eastern Universities along with many other civic boards.  
					Due to health problems, James did not seek re-election in 1985 and died in 1987. 
					Eleanor died in 2002.

	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Francis H. Cook, newspaper editor, town booster, farmer, inventor, land developer and visionary, arrived in Spokane in 1879. 
	  	  	  		He started Spokane’s first newspaper, The Spokan Times upon his arrival and published the paper until 1882. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Cook then set his sights on developing an area on Spokane’s South Hill. 
 	  	  	  		He purchased 680 acres and platted it out for development, including planning for a Montrose Park (now Manito). 
	  	  	  		In 1888, Cook started the first steam powered street railroad, the Spokane and Montrose Motor Railroad, to move residents up and down the hill. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Francis Cook lost everything in the Panic of 1893, losing all his property and his streetcar line but he did not give up on Spokane. 
	  	  	  		Around 1897, Cook and his family moved to property north of town that he had purchased before his financial collapse. 
	  	  	  		This 640 acre farm on the Little Spokane River contained an artificial lake, a mill and an ice house.  
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		During this period, Cook set his sights on “Old Baldy,” the mountain that was later renamed Mt. Spokane. 
	  	  	  		Cook believed that the city should build a road to the top of Mt. Spokane but could not get any support for his plan. 
	  	  	  		He purchased the top of the mountain in 1908 and set about securing the rights of way. 
	  	  	  		With the help of his sons, he began building the road himself. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		In 1912, a delegation from Spokane, including Washington State Governor Marion Hay and Spokane Mayor W. J. Hundley made a trip up the new road and named the mountain Mt. Spokane. 
	  	  	  		Cook sold the property to the county in 1920 and died a month later. 
	  	  	  		Others continued with Cook’s vision and Mount Spokane State Park was officially dedicated in 1927, becoming the first state park east of the Cascades and realized Cook’s vision for the mountain.

	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Bing Crosby, international singing and acting star, was born as Harry L. Crosby, Jr. in Tacoma in 1903, the fourth of seven children. 
	  	  	  		The family moved to Spokane in 1906 and Crosby's father built a house at 508 E. Sharp Avenue in 1913. 
	  	  	  		That house now sits on the campus of Gonzaga University. 
	  	  	  	</p>

	  	  	  		He attended Gonzaga for three years, but did not earn a degree. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Bing started singing with various bands in local theaters in Spokane before leaving for Los Angeles with his friend Al Rinker in 1925. 
	  	  	  		He and Rinker made some recordings together and Bing sang with various incarnations of bands before getting his solo recording contract in 1931 as well as landing his own radio show. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Debuting in 1931, his radio program became a big success, attracting as many as 50 million listeners during its peak, and lasting nearly grew 30 years on the airwaves. 
	  	  	  		He also signed a movie contract in early 1930s and made a number of musical comedies. 
	  	  	  		In the 1940s, he teamed with Bob Hope for the incredibly popular “Road” movies. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>

	  	  	  		He died of a heart attack while golfing in Spain in 1977.

	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Carl Maxey, civil rights leader, criminal defense attorney, and national collegiate boxing champion, was credited with “virtually singlehandedly desegregating much of the inland Northwest.” 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Maxey spent most of his childhood at the Spokane Children’s Home before being expelled at the age of 11 because the board voted to stop harboring “colored children.” 
	  	  	  		He lived briefly in the juvenile detention center before a Jesuit priest rescued him and took him to live on an Indian reservation in Idaho where Maxey learned to box. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		His athletic skills won him a scholarship to Gonzaga Prep. 
	  	  	  		After serving during World War II, Maxey came home and won scholarships to attend the University of Oregon and Gonzaga Law School where he was the only black student.  
					While attending Gonzaga, he won the collegiate light heavyweight boxing championship. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		In Spokane, he became the first black lawyer in Eastern Washington. 
	  	  	  		As an attorney, he used litigation to break down racial barriers at restaurants, private clubs and schools. 
	  	  	  		Maxey spent Freedom Summer (1964) in Mississippi and defended the Seattle Seven, an anti-Vietnam-War group.  
	  	  	  		In 1970, he represented the anti-war wing of the Democratic Party when he challenged Washington’s longtime incumbent Senator Henry M. (Scoop) Jackson. 

	  	  	  		At the time of his death in 1997, the Rev. Percy “Happy” Watkins, president of the Spokane County chapter of the NAACP said, “Carl Maxey, like Martin Luther King, was a drum major peace, a drum major for social justice, a drum major for equality and fairness.”

	  	  	  		Dr. Alan Hendrickson, pediatrician and children’s advocate, completed his medical degree at the University of Wisconsin and settled in Spokane in 1977. 
	  	  	  		He served families through the Rockwood Clinic from 1985 until his retirement in 2008.

	  	  	  	<p>

	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		In 1987, over lunch with CPS staff, Dr. Hendrickson diagrammed on a napkin a multidisciplinary approach to child abuse and neglect. 
	  	  	  		The organization which Dr. Hendrickson founded based on that sketch became Spokane Area Regional Center for Child Abuse and Neglect (RCCAN), a public-private partnership aimed at filling the gap in service to families. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Since his retirement, he has continued to work two days a week to the organization that is now called Partners with Families &amp; Children.

	  	  	  	</blockquote>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Elson S. Floyd was named Washington State University’s 10th president on December 13, 2006. 
	  	  	  		He took office on May 21, 2007 and died on June 20, 2015, of complications from colon cancer.
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
					Floyd transformed WSU into a top-tier research university while navigating some of the worst fiscal challenges in the institution’s history. 
					Under his leadership:
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<ul>
		  	  	  	<li>Overall student enrollment grew to record highs, reaching 28,686 in fall 2014. The number of students of color nearly doubled.</li>
					<li>Annual research expenditures grew by 57.5 percent from approximately $213.2 million in 2007 to more than $335.9 million in 2015, placing WSU in the top 11 percent of public universities for research funding.</li>
					<li>All of WSU’s health sciences programs were consolidated on its Spokane campus, including the colleges of nursing and pharmacy, and the new College of Medical Sciences.</li>
					<li>WSU won bipartisan support in the Washington state legislature to create its own, separately accredited medical school at WSU Health Sciences Spokane.</li>
					<li>WSU completed 30 major construction projects from 2007–2015, including one of the world’s most technologically advanced wine science centers at WSU Tri- Cities.</li>
					<li>The Paul G. Allen School for Global Animal Health opened with anchor gifts from Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</li>
					<li>The University successfully completed the $1 billion fundraising <i>Campaign for Washington State University: Because the World Needs Big Ideas</i>.</li>
  	      		</ul>
  	      		<p>
	  	      		Affectionately known as “E Flo,” President Floyd was a favorite among WSU students. 
				</p>
				<p>
	  	      		He always went out of his way to greet and visit with the students he encountered and knew many of them by name. 
	  	      		He once told a student reporter that as a college student he often felt invisible and didn’t want any WSU student to feel that way. 
	  	      	</p>
				<p>
					He and his wife, Carmento, attended many student-centered activities, including WSU sports events where they were known to cheer from the student section. 
	  	      	</p>
				<p>
	  	      		Thousands of students followed a Twitter account Dr. Floyd started as a way to better connect with them. 
	  	      		He gave many students his personal cell phone number and encouraged them to contact him if they needed anything.
				</p>
				<p>	
					President Floyd was deeply committed to WSU’s land-grant mission. 
					He was a visionary with enormous understanding of the modern land-grant university and the manner in which it should serve the public. 
				</p>
				<p>
					He pursued educational programs and research efforts that aligned the resources of WSU with the needs of Washington State and its people. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A champion of broadening access to higher education, President Floyd expanded WSU’s campuses in Spokane, Tri Cities, and Vancouver, and established the Global Campus and WSU North Puget Sound at Everett.

	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		King Cole, President of Expo &lsquo;74, was a 20<sup>th</sup> century visionary who changed the face of downtown Spokane.
	  	  	  		Cole was born in Colorado and served with the Navy during World War II before attending college and law school in California. 
	  	  	  		He was working as director of San Leandro, California’s development program when he came to Spokane in 1963 to assume leadership of Spokane Unlimited. 
	  	  	  		His mission was to revitalize the downtown business district and help Spokane’s sluggish economy. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		When he arrived in Spokane, railroad yards obscured the polluted Spokane River as it flowed through downtown.  
	  	  	  		Cole brought community groups together to clean up the river and the city’s image. Under Cole’s leadership, a business and citizens’ coalition came up with the idea of hosting a World’s Fair, but Expo was a means to an end to revitalize the river and downtown. 
	  	  	  		Cole coordinated local, state and national leaders and was instrumental in brokering the deal with the city and railroad officials for a land swap. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Expo &lsquo;74 was a huge success with Spokane becoming the smallest city ever to host a world’s fair, but its real achievement was the transformation of the river and the falls along with the creation of Riverfront Park. 
	  	  	  		He continued to support community partnerships for urban planning until his death in 2010.

	  	  	  	</blockquote>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Chief Spokan Garry, Indian leader, educator, missionary and farmer, was born around 1811.  
	  	  	  		His real name was Slough-Keetcha, and he was the son of the Spokan Chief Illm-Spokanee (<span class="chof-salish-regular">ilmz sPQNi/</span>). 
	  	  	  		In 1825, his father sent him to the Red River missionary society school established by the Hudson’s Bay Company where he was given the name Spokan Garry. 
	  	  	  		Garry spent five years at Red River, where he learned to speak, read and write both English and French. 
	  	  	  		When he returned, he taught both children and adults Christianity, as well as English and agricultural techniques.

	  	  	  		Because of his role as leader of the Middle and Upper bands of the Spokane tribe, along with his English language skills, Garry represented his people in treaty negotiations in the extraordinary times of military conflict with the white settlers. 
	  	  	  		Garry was a man of peace who tried to persuade the Spokane Indians not to fight the U. S. Army. 
	  	  	  		From 1859 until his death, Garry worked unsuccessfully to establish a reservation for the Spokane tribe on their homeland. 
	  	  	  		After white settlers dispossessed Garry and his family of his farm in 1888, Garry lived in poverty in Indian Canyon until his death in 1892.

	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		Elizabeth Welty, MD, practiced medicine in Spokane from 1949 until her retirement in 1985 in a joint practice with her late husband, Robert. 
	  	  	  		She has consistently advocated for and generously supported both public and private educational institutions, a broad spectrum of the arts and humanities, health-care institutions, human service organizations and, indeed, is involved in numerous activities that enhance the quality of life in Spokane. 
	  	  	  		In addition to financial support, she has given generously of her time as a volunteer board member to organizations across the community. 
	  	  	  	</p>
		  	  	  <p>
		  	  	  	Though raised and educated in the eastern US, she fully adopted her husband’s hometown, Spokane, when they moved here in 1945. 
		  	  	  	Her consistent and generous interest in doing all she can possibly do to enhance quality of life in Spokane has made a great difference in multiple programs in Spokane and in the region while Dr. Welty has remained quite modest about her outstanding accomplishments. 
		  	  	  	She will celebrate her 100th birthday in March, 2015.

	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		May Arkwright Hutton, working woman and suffragette, is still widely known in Spokane almost a hundred years after her death. 
	  	  	  		May was born in Ohio and migrated to Idaho in 1883 to take part in the gold rush.  
	  	  	  		Settling in Wardner Junction, she worked as a cook in a saloon before opening her own boardinghouse. 
	  	  	  		In 1887, she met and married Levi Hutton, a train engineer and they moved to Wallace, Idaho. 
	  	  	  		May worked running the restaurant in the Wallace hotel and was a union activist in violent times. 
	  	  	  	</p>
	  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  		In 1897, the Huttons bought a small interest in the Hercules mine and in 1901, the mine began producing silver. 
	  	  	  		Within ten years, they were millionaires but May’s lack of social skills, brusque manner and strong opinions did not fit into the social life of the wives of mine owners. 
	  	  	  		In 1904, she decided to run for the Idaho state legislature. 
	  	  	  		She won the Democratic ticket, but lost the election. 
	  	  	  		The Huttons moved to Spokane in 1906 and in moving to Washington, May lost her right to vote. 
	  	  	  		She quickly became active in the suffrage movement until Washington voters granted women the right to vote in 1910. 
	  	  	  		She was the first woman juror in Spokane County. 
	  	  	  		She remained active in Democratic politics, the peace movement and many charitable organizations supporting women and children. 
	  	  	  		When she died in 1915 at the age of 55, she was eulogized as an “author, suffragist, philosopher, humanitarian… who always fought on the moral side of all questions, and never forgot the poor and unfortunate.”
