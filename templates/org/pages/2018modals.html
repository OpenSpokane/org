                    Dr. George Bagby was an orthopedic surgeon, inventor and philanthropist who practiced medicine until he was 83 years old. While studying at the Mayo Clinic, he invented the “Bagby Bone Plate,” a self-compressing bone plate which helped facilitate the healing of fractures. He established his private practice in Spokane in 1956. In the 1970s, Bagby developed a relationship with the WSU veterinary program where he helped develop a procedure to fuse vertebrae in horses. The successful surgeries on horses led to the development of the Bagby and Kuslich (BAK) implant, which is now commonly used in human patients. In the horse world, Bagby is known for operating on triple-crown winner, Seattle Slew, in 2000. Bagby also volunteered with Orthopaedics Overseas, which sent him to Bangladesh where he eventually built a hospital. In 1990, he was named Spokane Physician of the year and in 2003 Rotary International awarded Bagby its Humanitarian Service Award. He was well-known at Shriner’s Hospital for Children where he arranged fishing trips for hospitalized children.

                    <p>
                    Sonora Smart Dodd, a Spokane mother, artist, and poet came up with the idea of Father’s Day after listening to a sermon about Mother’s Day and the virtues of motherhood. Sonora was sixteen when her mother died. He father William Jackson Smart dedicated himself to raising Sonora and her five younger brothers. After deciding that a day was needed to honor fathers, Sonora went to the Spokane Ministerial Alliance and the YMCA and they endorsed her proposition, proclaiming June 19, 1910 as the first Father’s Day. Preachers around Spokane delivered Father’s Day sermons and wire service stories picked it up. Other cities quickly began celebrating Father’s Day and by 1925, the entire country was paying tribute to fatherhood. In 1966, President Johnson signed a proclamation declaring the third Sunday in June as Father’s Day and in 1970, the U. S. Congress passed a joint resolution making it a national holiday which was signed by Richard Nixon.

                    <p>
                    Akhoy Kumar (A.K.) Mozumdar, a spiritual leader, was born in a small village about twenty miles north of Calcutta, India. Before coming to the United States, Mozumdar studied throughout India, as well as China and Japan. Mozumdar was a dynamic teacher, lecturer, and writer of the New Thought Movement in the United States. Mozumdar settled in Spokane in 1907. He formed the downtown Christian Yoga Church in Spokane and was the first Hindu to attain U.S. Citizenship. The law at the time offered citizenship only to “free born whites,” though there was no clear legal definition of the term. In 1912, Mozumdar applied for naturalization, ready to challenge the meaning of “whiteness.” He argued before a judge that he should be considered white as a rule caste of India and Spokane judge Frank H. Rudkin ruled for Mozumdar in May of 1913.  Mozumdar wrote his most influential book, The Life and the Way in 1911 while living in Spokane.

                    Myrtle Woldson, Spokane businesswoman and philanthropist, was born in Spokane to Martin and Edwidge Woldson. Her father made a fortune working for the railroads and investing in mining operations. Before he died in 1958 he taught his daughter about investing which lead her to estate investments in Spokane and Seattle, developing her own fortune. She gave money to the Moore-Turner Garden, and in 2010, the Spokane Park Board voted to rename Pioneer Park after Woldson’s mother in recognition. Additionally, she gave $3 million dollars to the Fox Theater in honor of her father and left money to Catholic Charities to expand care to Spokane’s homeless population. Miss Woldson developed a relationship with Gonzaga and after she died in 2014 at the age of 104, she left $55 million to Gonzaga, to build a performing arts center and to establish an endowment to provide scholarships which opens in 2019. Her gift to Gonzaga was the largest in Gonzaga’s history and the largest private gift in Washington State University.

                    Father Bernard J. Coughlin, S.J. arrived in Spokane in 1974 to lead Gonzaga University. Accomplishments in his 22 years as President (and subsequent 18 years as Chancellor) extend far beyond the University as he helped to expand not only Gonzaga’s impact but Spokane’s influence as well. A methodical approach to sound business management and a relentless commitment to educational excellence not only resolved the University’s fiscal challenges, but it put Gonzaga on a path of academic excellence and enrollment growth. Father Coughlin’s leadership has benefited the entire community in many ways. In 1988, Father Coughlin became the first Jesuit priest to serve as chair of a regional Chamber of Commerce. His reach extends today beyond the university to the betterment of Spokane as a whole.

                    Deb Harper, pediatrician, lived all over the west as a child. After moving to Chicago, she attended the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana for college and the University of Illinois in Chicago for medical school. She did a pediatric residency at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. She chose pediatrics because she wanted to help prevent lifestyle diseases and also help families nurture their children. She has done some international work, both for education and also some medical missions. She moved to Spokane in the spring of 1985. Harper practiced pediatrics at Group Health in Spokane until her retirement in April, 2018, and has been a consultant physician on child neglect and abuse prevention programs. She has been president of the Spokane County Medical Society, and is a member of the Executive Committee of the Washington State Medical Association. Harper has taught medical students in Spokane since 1985, and has directed the pediatrics clerkship for third-year UW medical students in Spokane.
