	Our librarians can search our records on your behalf for birth or death notices.
</p>
<p>
	We will search for <b>3 announcements at a time</b> and will search the newspaper for <b>5 days after an event date</b>. 
</p>
<p>
	You may interlibrary loan a microfilm copy of the newspaper from the State Library if you wish to continue the search yourself.
