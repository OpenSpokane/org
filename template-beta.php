      We are transitioning Spokane Public Library to a new website.
      During this time a few pages, including <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>, <a href="/book/">book a librarian</a>, and <a href="/connect/">other interactive forms</a>, are only available here on beta.spokanelibrary.org.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        All other pages are still located on <a href="http://www.spokanelibrary.org">our old website</a>.
        We understand this may be somewhat confusing, and we really appreciate your patience during this period.
